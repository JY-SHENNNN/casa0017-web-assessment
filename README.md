# CASA0017 Web Assessment London Tube Planner

Hello! Flora Shen is here 😀

---
🚇 The London Tube Planner is a web application designed to streamline journey planning by offering a comprehensive overview of tube travel. By entering a starting point and destination, users receive detailed real-time information regarding the tube lines connecting these locations. This includes `line names`, current operational `status`, estimated train `arrival times` and arrival `platform`, providing an efficient and user-friendly tool for navigating London’s tube network.
